COSMIC has been developed under the COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System
(COSMOS) project. The COSMOS project is funded by the Atmospheric Science, Hydrology,
and Ecology Programs of the US National Science Foundation (grant ATM-0838491).

Only tested with gfortran compiler version 4.6.2
gfortran -O3 -fbounds-check -o cosmic cosmic.f90

- The first column corresponds to vertical depth in centimeters
- Columns >2 correspond to soil moisture profiles (volumetric water content in m3/m3)

- The first row contains the simulated neutron flux with each column corresponding to the soil 
  moisture profile in the input data (notice a dummy value is generated in the first column,
  first row)
- Starting from the second row, the first column corresponds to the vertical depth in centimeters
  while columns >2 are the weighting factors calculated by COSMIC. If these weighting factors are
  aggregated until the last row, the sum should be 1. To calculate the effective depth, compute
  the cumulative weighting factor and find the depth at which the value is close to 86%.
